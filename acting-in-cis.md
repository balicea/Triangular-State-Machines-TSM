Relationship between sister nodes in a tree (acting in -_cis_):  

* equivalent values: uniform output (1-D).  

* high-low (or low-high) values: gradient (1-D).  


-_cis_ action can be unidirectional, omnidirectional, or stochastic:  

* unidirectional, impose gradient or pattern.  

* omnidirectional, replicate ground values.  

* stochastic, fluctuation over time results in higher-order patterns.
