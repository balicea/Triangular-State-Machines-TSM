An example of two overlapping trees, coding for outputs along the anterior-posterior axis:  

* an example of an [overlapping tree](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM/blob/master/overlapping-tree.png), with arcs acting in both _cis_ and _trans_.  

* the overlapping tree example with only the [anterior network being active](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM/blob/master/first-part-of-trajectory.png). Due to the overlapping topology, only a subset of nodes and arcs are active.  

* the overlapping tree example with the [posterior network being active](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM/blob/master/second-part-of-trajectory.png). Due to the overlapping topology, only a subset of nodes and arcs are active.
